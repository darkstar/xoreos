xoreos 0.0.1
============

xoreos will be a reimplementation of BioWare's Aurora engine (and derivatives),
its direct goal being having Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic working in
a portable manner. Other games might follow.


What is currently working, you might ask? Well...visibly, a bit. And quite
a lot of the "foundation" work is there. Resource management, basic file
formats, etc.. What you'll see when you sic xoreos on the installation
directory of a recognized game is, apart from the movies (Bink playback
courtesy of the ffmpeg project), stubby menus for NWN and KotOR, static 3D
geometry and/or music and/or sound, loaded from the actual data files.
Not really impressive yet, I know. :P

Will it ever be more? I don't know. This project was started out of a whim,
basically. Like with many of my projects, I don't work on it continously,
but on and off. There's no way I can actually finish this project on my
own, though.

Of course, if /you/ want to help, if /you/ want to work on it, I'd be quite
happy. Just drop me a mail (for organizational purposes). Don't be afraid,
I don't bite, I don't want to force anything on you. I'd just be interested
in what you're planning. :)

If you want to use the information within the project for your own Aurora-
related project, help yourself to the source. It's GPL for a reason. :)
